## 2024/08/06 - version: 0.6.5+28

Implement Favorite Button and User-Specific Features, Improve Scrolling and Mechanics Handling

The favorite button now appears only for logged-in users and is positioned over the product images in the current layout. On the "My Ads" page, buttons to edit and delete an ad are available, but only for ads with a pending or sold status. Active products cannot be edited or deleted. In the ShopScreen, reactivity has been added to adjust the display of favorites and the page header name based on whether the user is logged in or not.

Scrolling adjustments have been made to the ShopGridView and AdListView widgets to ensure smoother scrolling when loading new ads. The control of mechanics has been migrated from the Parse server to a local SQLite database. These mechanics consist of relatively static information that does not change frequently, hence they have been incorporated into the app. Data from BGG and the annual ranking table have also been integrated into the application.

These changes enhance user-specific features and optimize the handling of mechanics by migrating data control to a local SQLite database. The integration of user-specific features and the optimization of mechanics handling ensure a more efficient and user-friendly experience. This set of changes introduces significant improvements to user interactions, performance enhancements, and the transition to local storage for mechanics, providing a more robust and efficient application experience.

Deletions primarily focus on removing configuration files and setups specific to Flutter's macOS, windows and Linux descktop implementations, cleaning up the project and reducing dependencies. Additional deletions continue the clean-up process by removing configuration files and assets specific to the macOS platform, further simplifying the project and focusing on the core Flutter application. The final batch of deletions completes the removal of configuration files, scripts, and assets specific to the macOS and Windows platforms.
